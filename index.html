  <h1 id="title">Terence Tao</h1>
  <p>Terence Chi-Shen Tao FAA FRS (born 17 July 1975) is an Australian-American mathematician
  who has worked in various areas of mathematics. He currently focuses on harmonic analysis,
  partial differential equations, algebraic combinatorics, arithmetic combinatorics, geometric 
  combinatorics, compressed sensing and analytic number theory. As of 2015, he holds the James and 
  Carol Collins chair in mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Tao was a recipient
  of the 2006 Fields Medal and the 2014 Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics. He is a Fellow of the Royal
  Society, the Australian Academy of Science (Corresponding Member), the National Academy of Sciences 
  (Foreign member), the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Mathematical Society.
  In 2006 he received the Fields Medal "for his contributions to partial differential equations, 
  combinatorics, harmonic analysis and additive number theory", and was also awarded the MacArthur Fellowship.
  He has been featured in <a class="Times" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/13/science/13prof.html" > 
  The New York Times</a>, CNN, USA Today, Popular Science, and many other media outlets.
By 2016, Tao had published about 300 research papers and 17 books. He has an Erdős number of 2.
In 2018, Tao proved bounding the de Bruijn–Newman constant. </p>

   <p>" Such is Tao's reputation that mathematicians now compete to interest him in their problems, 
   and he is becoming a kind of Mr Fix-it for frustrated researchers.
   If you're stuck on a problem, then one way out is to interest Terence Tao,"<br>-
